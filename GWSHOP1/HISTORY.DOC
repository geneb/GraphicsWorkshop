    =====================================================================

LINEBVE.ASM and LINEBFVE.ASM    11-30-90
New routines to draw boxes and filled boxes.

GWDECL.BAS                      11-30-90
Added LineBVE and LineBVFE.

Modified the following routines to use the LineBVE and LineBFVE routines,
instead of using BASIC's equivalents:

BUTTON.BAS          DEMOBNCH.BAS        DEMOBOX.BAS         DEMOBYTE.BAS
DEMOCIRC.BAS        DEMOCURS.BAS        DEMODIGI.BAS        DEMOEDIT.BAS
DEMOFADE.BAS        DEMOFX.BAS          DEMOGW.BAS          DEMOINTR.BAS
DEMOMENU.BAS        DEMOMOUS.BAS        DEMOMOVE.BAS        DEMOPAL.BAS
DEMOPULL.BAS        DEMOSCRL.BAS        DEMOSCRN.BAS        DEMOSHAD.BAS
DEMOVERT.BAS        DIGITIZE.BAS        DRAWTEXT.BAS        FILLPOLY.BAS
INTER1.BAS          OUTLTEXT.BAS        PULLDOWN.BAS        QSEGUE.BAS
SEGUE2.BAS          SEGUE3.BAS          SEGUE4.BAS          SEGUE5.BAS
SEGUE6.BAS          SEGUE7.BAS          XORBOX.BAS          ZOOM.BAS

QSEGUE.BAS                      11-30-90
Fixed a bug that called QBinaryLoad% incorrectly, and returned an error in
loading the file even though the file was loaded correctly.

SAVEPCXC.ASM and SAVEPCXH.ASM   11-30-90
New routines to save .PCX images from a CGA and Hercules respectively.

^-------------------------------- Version 1.01 ------------------------------^

SAVEPCXE.ASM, SAVEPCXC.ASM, SAVEPCXH.ASM     12-05-90
Modified routines to correctly use BASIC 7's far strings.

^-------------------------------- Version 1.02 ------------------------------^

FADEEGA.ASM                                  12-05-90
Moved the data contained in FADEDATA.GW so that it is contained in the Code
Segment and not the data segment.  This freed up 10K of string space which
was found to be neccessary on some machines when running programs like the
QSEGUE.BAS demo.

DIGITIZE.BAS                                 12-06-90
Modified routine to use SetGWPages to change the active page, rather than
using the BASIC screen statement.

MOUSECNT.BAS                                 12-06-90
Modified the routine GetCountLocation% and GetMouseCount% to use the routines
MBuffSize% and MGetState which performed the same functions as the Mouse
routine used earlier.  Also the Mouse routine is not capable of accepting Far
strings from BASIC 7.

SCRNDMP2.ASM                                 12-06-90
Fixed the routine to provide BC7 compatibility for far strings.

GPRINT1E.ASM                                 12-06-90
Modified the Row positioning to follow the actual number of bytes in the
height of individual characters.  The routine GPrint0VE already used the
proper value.

GWDECL.BAS                                   12-09-90
Added a DECLARE statement for the already existing PaintBits routine to the
declare file to make using the PaintBits routine simpler.

FILLPOLY.BAS                                 12-12-90
In some cases, the FillPoly routine ended prematuraly, leaving a pixel hole
in the surrounding outline.

FONT64.BAS                                   12-13-90
This example program has received message boxes to tell users when they have
attempted to perform a function when it was not the proper time to do so.  The
messages will help reduce users questions by providing them with an
explanation of what they have done.  Also the menus can be activated with
Alt-MenuKey key combinations, and the Help function now has a listing of the
available quick keys that can be used in the program.

^-------------------------------- Version 1.03 ------------------------------^

PULLDNMS.BAS                                 12-15-90
Added a PullDnMSG routine to simulate a Microsoft Windows Pull Down menu
system using HotKeys and running in graphics mode.  The DEMOPLMS.BAS demo has
been added as well.

PULLDOWN.BAS and VERTMENU.BAS                12-15-90
Added a work-around to fix a bug in the Logitech mouse driver that required
you to jiggle the mouse before it would work.

PULLDOWN.BAS                                 12-15-90
Changed the PullMenKey routine name to PullMenKeyG to avoid a conflict with
QuickPak Professional.

GETVIDEO.BAS                                 12-15-90
Added an initialization for element 86 of the GPDat%() array.  The 86th
element is a True/False variable which tells the OutlineText routine whether
or not to fill in the outlined text.  A value of 0 means to color it in.  Any
other value will cause the OutlineText routine to draw an outline only.

OUTLTEXT.BAS                                 12-15-90
Modified the OutlineText routine to utilize the 86th element of the GPDat%()
array to determine if it should draw the outline only, and not fill in the
individual letters.  (See above)

SHADEH.BAS and SHADEV.BAS                    12-15-90
Added ShadeH and ShadeV routines to SHADEH.BAS and SHADEV.BAS respectively.
These routines differ from the ShadeHorizontal and ShadeVertical routines only
in the use of the mixed coordinate system which makes them faster.

MSGBOX.BAS, PULLDOWN.BAS, VERTMENU.BAS, PULLDNMS.BAS  12-15-90
All of the shadows in each of these routines have been shortened.  This will
allow the routines to seem faster.

FONTS.BAS                                    12-17-90
The source for the GraphPak font editor has been added.  It has been modified
to handle the extended character set.  An associated EuroGPFonts% flag has
been added to the Graphics Workshop routines to handle this change.

EURO.GPK, EURO.GFN                           12-17-90
This font file contains all of the characters in the extended character set
as well as all normal characters.

FONT64.BAS                                   12-17-90
The Graphics Workshop Vector font editor has been modified to use the extended
character set, and the vector file format has been reduced in size.  A feature
has also been added to the Edit menu to duplicate an existing character into
the definition for the character currently being edited.

EURO.QFN                                     12-17-90
This font file contains the standard helvetica vector font and some of the
European characters.  It demonstrates the ability for the extended characters
to be defined in vector fonts.

DEMOEURO.BAS                                 12-18-90
This example program has been added to demonstrate the ability of the font
systems to use the extended character set.  (See above)

SAVEPCXE.ASM                                 12-18-90
A bug was fixed in this routine which did not set the proper image size of the
image being saved.

GW.LIB, GW7.LIB                              12-18-90
The routine InStat% covered in the manual was added to these libraries, and to
the respective .QLB quick libraries.

FADEEGA.ASM                                  12-18-90
A bug was fixed in this routine.  The Grid locations now follow the manual's
description.

FADE2EGA.ASM                                 12-18-90
The routine Fade2EGA was added to Graphics Workshop.  It uses a smaller grid
region and hence works faster than the FadeEGA routine.

SETVIDEO.BAS                                 12-20-90
A call to InitMouse was added from within the SetVideo routine to change the
settings in the mouse driver to coincide with the currently set video mode.

VIEWPCX.BAS                                  12-20-90
This example program has been modified for easier use within the QuickBASIC
environment.  It no longer uses the Graphics Workshop Screen setting routines
like "CALL Screen12".  It instead uses BASIC's SCREEN statements.

DISPPCXE.ASM, DISPPCXH.ASM, DISPPCXV.ASM, DISPPCXC.ASM, PCXARAYE.ASM,
PCXARAYH.ASM, PCXARAYV.ASM, PCXARAYC.ASM    12-20-90 A bug was fixed in these
routines.  The parameter for the VideoPage% has been changed to be an
absolute video page, and is no longer affected by the Destination page value
set by the SetGWPages routine.

GMOVE2VE.ASM                                 12-20-90
A bug in this was changed.  The Col% parameter now goes follows the mixed
coordinate system as covered in the manual.

DEMOMOUS.BAS                                 12-20-90
An example of using the GraphCursor routine to redefine the shape of the mouse
cursor has been added to this demonstration program.

The routine LineToStepVE has been added to draw a line from the last cursor
location to the location a specified distance away.  LineToStepVE calls on
LineVE for the actual drawing of the line.

LINSTPVE.ASM                                 1-21-91
The routine LineStepVE has been added to draw a line from a specified distance
away from the last drawing location, to another specified distance away from
the same reference point.

SLIDRGHT.ASM, SLIDLEFT.ASM, SLIDDOWN.ASM, and SLIDUP.ASM    1-21-91 These
routines have been converted to assembly langaueg and placed in GW.LIB.  The

Added assignments for GPDat%(72) (the starting address for the second video
page) for EGA/VGA SCREEN 9 and VGA SCREEN 12.

^-------------------------------- Version 1.13 ------------------------------^

PULLDNMS.BAS and PULLDOWN.BAS   1-2-92
Further modified to correctly use the BarLine (and BarLCol in PULLDNMS)
constant to let the menu be displayed at any row and column.  Also modified
DEMOPLMS.BAS to use GPrint0VE instead of BASIC print statements.

^-------------------------------- Version 1.14 ------------------------------^
FONT64.BAS                   5/01/92 The Font64.BAS vector font editor has
been enhanced in several ways. The most important enhancement is the addition
of full mouse support. In addition, three new menu options have been added:


1. Pick ASCII        This option lets you select a character without diplaying
                     a "Graphpak" reference character.

2. Delete Paint      Lets you delete a pre-defined paint point. Place the
                     cursor over the point to be removed and press Enter.

3. Clear Character   Clears the current character's font definition from
                     memory and lets you define a new character from scratch


Adding mouse support required that the procedure for moving lines be slightly
modified. When using a mouse, you can click on the point to be moved and drag
it with the mouse to its new position. Pressing Enter will set the new
location. When using the keyboard, you must first locate the cursor at an
intersection and then press Enter. The point can then be moved by using the
standard cursor keys or the mouse. You can continue to move lines or cancel
the procedure by clicking the right mouse button or by pressing Escape.

The pull-down menu can be accessed at any time by clicking the right mouse
button or by clicking on the menu bar with the left mouse button.

ANIMATE.BAS                 5/01/92
Written by tech support specialist Carl Franklin, this demo shows how simple
animation can be achieved using partial .PCX files and the Graphic WorkShop's
GMove2VE routine.

GPRINT0C.ASM                 5/01/92
Modified to print text correctly on old CGA monitors. The earlier version only
worked correctly on the current generation of CGA monitors.

^-------------------------------- Version 1.15 ------------------------------^

9/9/94 Some of the ASM source code supplied was not as current as the routines
contained in the library. This has been corrected.  

Modified assembly code to handle data spanning segment boundries.

^------------------------------ 1.17---------------------------------------^

1/23/97 Added a non-proportional font display subroutine in DRWTXTNP.BAS.

^------------------------------ 1.18---------------------------------------^

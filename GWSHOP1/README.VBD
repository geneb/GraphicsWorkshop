Graphics WorkShop now supports Visual Basic for DOS. When running
Graphics WorkShop under VBDos, use the GWVBD.QLB quick library.  If you
compile and link your programs from the command line, you must link with
the GW7.LIB library.  If you prefer to compile and link from the VBDOS
environment, you will need to rename GW7.LIB to GWVBD.LIB.  This is
easily done with the DOS RENAME command:

REN GW7.LIB GWVBD.LIB
